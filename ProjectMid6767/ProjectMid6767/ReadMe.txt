This Code Blocks project has 3 classes and a main file- 

1. main.cpp - This has the actual code implementation along with running unit test cases.
2. Option class - Is the standard Option class with all its functionalities and Option attributes. Functions - BlacK Scholes price and delta calculation.
3. unit_test class - Is the class that is used to run the unit test cases.

4 output files are generated from the code - 
Task 1
1. Stock Path Simulation
2. Option Price Simulation
3. Hedge Error (Simulation)
Task 2
4. result file

5 code files in total. Location: \Submission\ProjectMid6767\ProjectMid6767

There is ProjectMid6767.exe (which is Windows App) is located in \Submission\ProjectMid6767\Debug\ProjectMid6767.exe which has built the project and runs the program. The .exe file can be run to implement to code.

The Jypyter notebook for analysis is at \Submission\analysis_notebook.ipynb
